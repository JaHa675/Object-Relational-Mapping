## Description

a small project to demonstrate how I would go about creating the database for a simple product catagorizing system using sequelize.

---

## Installation

Requires a few npm packages to work. Namely express, sequelize, mysql2,  and dotenv. Requires you to create a .env file to host your own username and password for mysql. once thats out of the way, you'll need to initiate the database with mysql by logging in through your terminal and then running SOURCE schema.sql. and finally, you can run the server file with node.

## Usage

Used to store data for a small place of business, as it doesn't have the framework around it to make it user friendly enough for wide usage.
